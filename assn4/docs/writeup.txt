For the final homework assignment, I chose to refactor my sudoku
solver to add a GUI in addition to the existing CLI.

To start with, I chose to use the tkinter library for the GUI 
design. I had never used it before, but I found it fairly easy
to pick up and make a simple GUI program with it.

As part of this refactoring assignment, I used the Command pattern 
to improve the sudoku solver. I used it in two places : First I used 
it for the sudoku solving strategies as part of the back end sudoku 
solver code. This allows the sudoku solver to manage a history of 
these commands, and to undo them.

I also used the Command pattern along with a Command Factory as 
part of the GUI. The commands used here were much simpler. This 
was done to reduce coupling between the GUI and the underlying 
sudoku solver class.
